### Projects and Accomplishments

My favorite projects I've built so far would be...

- A 'Battleships' web-game with a Model/View/Controller architecture. Made with JS/HTML/CSS.

- A 'text scraper' that runs though a pdf or website and uses RegEx to scrape out phone numbers, emails, and names. Then formats them neatly and places them in a new directory. Made with Python.

- A CMS where users can upload recipes to share with other users, has login with username and encrypted passwords, can comment and share. Made with PHP, MySQL, uses PHPmyAdmin.

- A 'Grocery Store' online storefront application with a back-end admin site. Shoppers can create an account, add items to cart, easily modify cart, and checkout. The store manager can add new products, new categories, process orders, and generate sales reports. Clean and fast database design. Made with PHP, MySQL, uses PHPmyAdmin.

- A CLI app where a virtual butler helps schedule your goals and to-dos. Made with Nodejs.
