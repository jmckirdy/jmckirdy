### Projects and Accomplishments

My favorite projects I've built so far would be...

- A 'Battleships' web-game with a Model/View/Controller architecture. Made with JS/HTML/CSS.

- A 'text scraper' that runs though a pdf or website and uses RegEx to scrape out phone numbers, emails, and names. Then formats them neatly and places them in a new directory. Made with Python.

- A fun little text-based adventure game where your choices lead you through a myserious forest in search of hidden treasure. You must overcome obstacles and retrieve a secret password from a fair maiden in order to unlock the treasure chest at the end. Made with Python

- Currently working on a CLI app where a virtual butler helps you schedule your goals and to-dos. Made with Nodejs.

**I am building out repos for these projects...
