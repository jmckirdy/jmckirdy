### Projects and Accomplishments

My favorite projects I've built so far would be...

- A 'Grocery Store' online storefront application with a back-end admin site. Shoppers can create an account, add items to cart, easily modify cart, and checkout. The store manager can add new products, new categories, process orders, and generate sales reports. Clean and fast database design. Made with PHP, MySQL, uses PHPmyAdmin.

- The game I'm working on --ForgeCraft-- It's currently in a Private Repo, but here's a little teaser -- ForgeCraft is a nostalgic, idle, clicker game that blends survival, a rich story-line, and resource-hoarding. You play as Gerald, a hapless man whose family has gone missing during the Great Mutant Revolt. -- Play soon @ ForgeCraft.org

- A CLI app where a virtual butler named 'Jeeves' helps schedule your goals and to-dos. Made with Nodejs.

- My Homepage: johnmckirdy.com, where my 'Battleships' game is hosted. Made with JS/Jquery/HTML/CSS, Game is MVC architecture

- A 'text scraper' that crawles though pdfs and websites using RegEx to scrape phone numbers, emails, and names. Then presents the data neatly in a new directory. Made with Python.

- A CMS where users can upload recipes to share with other users, has login with username and encrypted passwords, can comment and share. Made with PHP, MySQL, uses PHPmyAdmin.
